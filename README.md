# SCP: Secret Laboratory DLL
### About this codebase
This project was made by me and another developer almost a year and a half ago, under the name Temperate, where we sold a p2c software to several users, which was eventually shut down due to personal reasons and lack of time to manage it. Everything in here is most likely outdated and a new SDK is required because the old dumper is lost / doesn't work with new versions of SCP:SL. Do not open issues on this repository as I am no longer maintaining this code base at all, this is simply a proof of concept / paste haven for those out there looking into getting intom modding unity il2cpp games or bypassing simple usermode anticheats.

### Further to note
This is the current source (well not really current, but most of the features and exploits) of MIDNIGHT SCPSL, ran by t1f7.
